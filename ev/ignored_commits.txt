    syscall: latch errno deeper in the buffer implementation (#3880)

    The errno set by a syscall can be overwritten by code (e.g. logging) as
    it propagates up through the call stack. This commit refactors the
    buffer API to allow for returning the errno from deeper down the call
    stack i.e. as soon as a syscall is performed.
